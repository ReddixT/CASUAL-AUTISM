This Mod is currently in a MP only state. Almost every country has a historical more accurate National Focus Tree. They got new Focuses, new Ideas etc. The Mod has also an Island Hopping Mechanic. It's pretty balanced between Allies and Axis. The game is very optimized and runs much faster than vanilla.
