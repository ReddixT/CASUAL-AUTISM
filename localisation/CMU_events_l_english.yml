 finland.20.t:0 "The Liberation of Finland"
 finland.20.d:0 "The Finnish proletariat along with our communist comrades have languished in Finland since the Reds lost the civil war. Germany has meanwhile become increasingly militaristic and jingoistic, constituting an existential threat to the union. We have demanded that Finland hand over border territories that we need to secure ourselves, but predictably they have rejected them. It is now time to prepare an invasion of Finland and liberate them from capitalist oppression."
 finland.20.a:0 "We will drop 'bread baskets' on them."
 finland.21.t:0 "The Soviet Union Prepares for War"

 britain.1113.d:0 "The Scandanavian nation of Norway has fallen under attack by Axis forces.

 italy.144.t:0 "The Fate of Ethiopia"
 italy.144.d:0 "Ethiopia has long been a thorn in the side of Italian national pride since losing the last Italo-Ethiopian War. Now the world may look upon Italy's ascendency as the masters of the Mediterrenean. King Victor Emmanuel III has bestowed the title of 'Duke of Addis Ababa' to Marshal Pietro Badoglio for his work.  Ethiopia can either be administtered directly by Italy, or as part of a colonial puppet state administered by a colonial viceroy."

 italy.146.t:0 "Mussolini Arrested"
 italy.146.d:0 "Following our failures in North Africa and the subsequent Allied invasion of Southern Italy, support for Il Duce has fallen dramatically. With war raging on our soil, and with chronic food shortages, and worsening labor strikes, the Grand Council of Italy has turned against Mussolini in a vote of no confidence. King Victor Emmanuel himself has dismissed Il Duce and ordered his arrest, replacing him with Marshal Pietro Badoglio. Mussolini has been transported all around Italy before finally being imprisoned at Campo Imperatore, a ski resort in Abruzzo."
 italy.146.a:0 "Who will make the trains run on time?"

 italy.147.t:0 "Monarchist Coup d'Etat in Italy"
 italy.147.d:0 "Following Italian incompetence in North Africa and the subsequent Allied invasion of Southern Italy, our all Mussolini, has been betrayed by his countrymen and is now under arrest somewhere in Italy. This is very dangerous for the Reich, as without Mussolini we cannot expect Italy to continue staying in the war on our side. We must carefully consider our next moves."
 italy.147.a:0 "Contact the Abwehr - we must find where Mussolini is being held immediately"
 italy.147.b:0 "This is Italian incompetence at it's finest - we can win the war without their help"

 italy.148.t:0 "Benito Mussolini Located"
 italy.148.d:0 "Thanks to the Abwehr decoding an Italian radio message, we have located Mussolini to a sky resort in Abruzzo near Gran Sasso mountain. High Command has already drawn up several plans for rescuing Mussolini, but the finest of which has come from one of our star generals: Kurt Student. He has planned for a daring Commando raid on the ski resort using a glider plane for transport."
 italy.148.a:0 "Student has proven himself time and time again - make it so."
 italy.148.b:0 "This isn't worth the effort - cancel all plans to intervene."

 italy.149.t:0 "Mussolini Freed"
 italy.149.d:0 "At 1400 today, German SS and Fallschirmjäger troops have made a daring assault on the Campo Imperatore Hotel, freeing Benito Mussolini from his imprisonment. The hotel was stormed without firing a shot, with the few defenders inside surrendering immediately. Mussolini is now to be flown to Munich for a meeting with the Fuhrer. We expect him to co-operate more closely with the Reich and under our supervision."
 italy.149.a:0 "Leave it to a German to save Italy."

 italy.150.t:0 "The Banda Koch"
 italy.150.d:0 "Since the declaration of the Italian Social Republic, anti-Fascist elements from the right, center, and left have been launching raids and attacks against our army. These unpatriotic elements have been a thorn in our side, but in response Pietro Koch, a disreputable Italian of German descent, has formed an anti-partisan unit called 'Banda Koch' to crack down on these terrorists. Their methods, however, are excessive."
 italy.150.a:0 "It is a temporary situation anyways."

 italy.151.t:0 "Il Duce Returns!"
 italy.151.d:0 "Thanks to German bravery and ingenuity, Mussolini has been freed from his detainment and returned to power. The Italian state is to be remade into a republic, as, to quote Mussolini, "It is not the regime that has betrayed the monarchy, it is the monarchy that has betrayed the regime." The new state is to be called 'The Italian Social Republic'."

 tfv_south_africa.133.d:0 "Today, Prime Minister J. B. M. Hertzog attempted to declare neutrality towards the Nazi aggression in Europe, and attempted to leave South Africa out of the war, as allowed by the Stature of Westminster. However, the bill was rejected by Parliament in Pretoria, led by Jan Smuts, 80 votes to 67.
